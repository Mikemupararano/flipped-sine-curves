# Flipped Sine Graphs

## Description
This code defines a function called sinplot which generates a plot of sinusoidal curves. This function named sinplot takes two optional parameters n and flip. n determines the number of sine curves to be plotted, and flip determines whether the curves are flipped or not. This code generates 100 evenly spaced points between 0 and 14. These points are the x-coordinates for plotting the sine curves.
Inside the loop, plt.plot() function is used to plot each sinusoidal curve. The np.sin() function generates the sine values for each x-coordinate, x + i * .5 shifts the sine curve horizontally for each iteration of the loop, and (n + 2 - i) * flip determines the amplitude of the curve, with flip controlling the direction of the flip.

In summary, this function generates a plot with multiple sinusoidal curves, each slightly shifted horizontally and potentially flipped vertically, with the number and properties of the curves determined by the parameters n and flip.
